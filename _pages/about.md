Hey there, I am Thanos. Welcome to my personal web page.

I am a PhD candidate at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (AUTH) in the department of Meteorology and Climatology. My research is concentrated on chemical-climate interactions and more specifically on natural dust-climate interactions with the use of the regional climate model RegCM4.

I am focusing on how dust is simulated in numerical models (emission, transport, deposition), quantifying the dust direct and semi-direct effect over the greater area Europe, Mediterranean and Sahara desert as well as investigating the long-range Trans-Antlantic transport of dust from the Sahara desert to the American continent.

Over the last few years I had the opportunity to work with various climate related topics. I investigated the connection of the Etesian winds with near-surface ozone and its photochemical production over the Aegean sea followed by a thorough evaluation of MACC reanalysis near-surface ozone over Europe. I digitized and engaged in the quality control of station based historical meteorological data scattered all over the globe. Participated in a multi-model evaluation of regional climate simulations over Europe of the CORDEX project and aid in the development of a user friendly application for climate simulations data and indices sharing within the framework of the GEOCRADLE project.

As you already figured out I have a broad interest on anything related to Earth's system, but my passion is not limited on our small rocky planet. Astronomy and anything space related always fascinated me. Although I don't actively participate scientifically on these field, I closely follow the latest news about our solar system or the discovery of new exoplanets and the theories on how these planetary systems may be.

I hope you find something useful/helpful on this web page. Take care and keep in touch!
